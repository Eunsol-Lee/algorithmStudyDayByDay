# Algorithm Study Day By Day
Algorithm study using python day by day


Since April 4, 2017, I will study algorithm using python.
And I will participate in Google Code Jam 2017.
So, I will focus [past contest of Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/past-contests).

## Future work
+ [Google Code Jam 2016 Round 1C](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/11254486/dashboard)
+ Graph theory study (find the connected components using DFS and other ways and find the longest chains)
+ Graph algorithm such as Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Hopcroft-Karp algorithm

### [Day 6](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day6_GoogleCodeJam2017_QualificationRound) April 9, 2017
[Google Code Jam 2017 Qualification Round](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard) solved using python
I get 50 points on qualification round.
First problem [Oversized Pancake Flipper](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard) was easy. I used greedy algorithm. Whenever there is a '-', I flipped. But I think I could ameliorate my solution if I just count changing point.
Second problem [Tidy Numbers](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard#s=p1) was easy. But I failed two times on small input. I used wrong algorithm at first. I realized the problem during challenging, I fixed it.
Third problem [Bathroom Stalls](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard#s=p2) was not easy. I used mathematical solution, but official solution looked more simple. And I got 'incorrect' judgement on large input. That was because of python division logic. Using '//' instead of '/' had solved my problem.
I couldn't solve last problem [Fashion Show](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard#s=p3) during competition. After end of the competition, I saw contest analysis, and solved. It is greedy but very interesting and hard.

### Day 5 April 8, 2017
Rest

### [Day 4](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day2_GoogleCodeJam2016_Round1A) April 7, 2017
[Google Code Jam 2016 Round 1B](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/11254486/dashboard) solved using python
I also studied basic of linear algebra due to [problem A. Getting the Digits](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/11254486/dashboard). I was very impressed about linear algebra solution that I saw in [Contest Analysis](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/11254486/dashboard#s=a&a=0).
I need to study graph algorithms also.

### Day 3 April 6, 2017
Rest

### [Day 2](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day2_GoogleCodeJam2016_Round1A) April 5, 2017
[Google Code Jam 2016 Round 1A](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4304486/dashboard) solved using python
I also upload [c++ code](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day2_GoogleCodeJam2016_Round1A/2016%20Live%20Coding%20using%20CPP%20by%20Eunsol) when I competed last year. It is fun to compare between c++ code and python code.

### [Day 1](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day1_GoogleCodeJam2016_QuallificationRound) April 4, 2017
[Google Code Jam 2016 Qualification Round](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard) solved using python
I also upload [c++ code](https://github.com/Eunsol-Lee/algorithmStudyDayByDay/tree/master/day1_GoogleCodeJam2016_QuallificationRound/2016%20Live%20Coding%20using%20CPP%20by%20Eunsol) when I competed last year. It is fun to compare between c++ code and python code.
